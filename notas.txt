 --------------------------------- START GIT COURSE ------------------------------------

 For working with Git we use System Console, Exampel; CMD, npm, terminal of vsc. e.t.c
 
  ------- Basic commands; 
 
 . Git init (start control versions in directory)
 . git add <file name> (add files for modified)
 . git status (look at the status of the files)
 . git commit (move files from staging area to repository)
 . git push (upload files to remote repository)
 . git pull (they give me other people's changes)
 . git clone (clone existing repository)


 Git have three states:
 
 . working directory (where we working with our files);
 . staging area (where will be, our files modified, waiting to upload to the repository);
 . repository (where it will be, our complete code, first version of your application);

 to ignore folders or files we use ".gitignore" in our editor, inside ".gitignore" we write the names of the files or folders that we want to ignore

for to create alternative version of our code, we create a new branch in git:

    for default, our project will be at branch (master)

. git branch (show me all branchs of my project)
. git branch <name of new branch> (we created new branch)
. git checkout <name of branch> (we swtich at branch)

 for watch differences come in old file and file recently modified, we use in git "git diff <name file>"
