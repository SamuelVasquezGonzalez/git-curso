 --------------------------------- START GIT COURSE ------------------------------------

 For working with Git we use System Console, Exampel; CMD, npm, terminal of vsc. e.t.c
 
  ------- Basic commands; 
 
 . Git init (start control versions in directory)
 . git add <file name> (add files for modified)
 . git status (look at the status of the files)
 . git commit (move files from staging area to repository)
 . git push (upload files to remote repository)
 . git pull (they give me other people's changes)
 . git clone (clone existing repository)


 Git have three states:
 
 . working directory (where we working with our files);
 . staging area (where will be, our files modified, waiting to upload to the repository);
 . repository (where it will be, our complete code, first version of your application);

 to ignore folders or files we use ".gitignore" in our editor, inside ".gitignore" we write the names of the files or folders that we want to ignore
